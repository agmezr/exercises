#About this repo
This is a simple repo that will have multiple exercises found around the web. I will try that every exercise has the description of the problem. Most of the problems will have the shortest possible solution, this means that most of them will not be much readable, **but** i will **try** to include the readable *version* and the simplified

Have fun!
